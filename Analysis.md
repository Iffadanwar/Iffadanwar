# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise's would like to know how much of her crowd-sourced play "fever" faired compared to other plays when it comes to the goal amount raised on the website "Kickstarter". 
Using data from that site allows the curation and visualization of the relevant data needed to understand other theatre plays and how well they fair against "Fever".  
An additional purpose is to better understand excel and the different processes required to more efficiently sift through data to eventually create relevant visuals. 

## Analysis and Challenges
Using excel's built-in tools such as Pivot tables, "Build graph", and "COUNTIFS()" tools I was quickly able to understand and achieve my goals. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The build-up and fall off of the month may seem to have the most chances of success for Kickstarter campaigns. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Generally, the trend shows that higher fundraising thresholds mean that there is a less likely chance of success.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I encountered a problem using the "COUNTIFS()" function as I was not getting the correct results I needed. After an hour of trying to understand where I went wrong, I
discovered I did not add "=" in any of my formulas which were keeping 300 values from being counted. after that, the processes were fairly simple.

### Results
Overall it is best to start a Kickstarter campaign for a play around springtime (April to July) and aiming to have a goal of less than $15000 is a key factor in determining if the Kickstarter campaign will be a success. 

## What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes-based on the Launch Date?
After observing trends of theatre plays over the course of a few years, the data shows that April to August tends to have a higher number of successes for American plays. With May and June being the best overall.
However, the number of failed attempts to reach fundraising goals is fairly consistent throughout the year. Cancelled attempts remain low throughout the year. 

## What can you conclude about the Outcomes-based on Goals?
The data tend to show that having higher fundraising goals reduces the chance of success especially in values over $20,000. Despite a few instances between the values of $35,000-$44,999 showing higher chances
of success, these are mostly due to a lack of data and a small samples size. The data also shows that 91% of all plays have fundraising goals less than $15,000 which is also the range where plays tend to see success.

## What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data set falls short on data for higher value Kickstarter. As it is harder to succeed if you have a larger goal, many people do not pursue Kickstarters for goals higher than 25,000 making data for that
range sparse. Also Since this database deals with entertainment, it doesn't consider marketing or other tactics fundraisers may have used to gain popularity and in turn gain success in reaching their goal.
Also, Kickstarter is only one type of fundraising method and may show false trends that may be well established outside of the site.

## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
To better understand Launch dates, a stacked bar graph would show how certain months could have a higher amount of launch dates in general which could also play a factor in the chances of success. This is because if more plays are being posted, it may have the effect of increasing the popularity of actually funding plays. 
A box plot would also help identify outliers using the IQR method which could be further studied specifically to understand why they succeeded or failed.
